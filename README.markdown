RubyScope Bundle
================

A TextMate bundle that provides fast searches against ruby code.

Known Issues
------------
RubyParser sometimes provides inaccurate line numbers, so the results occasionally look a 
bit funny.

Doesn't do a whole lot at the moment, still getting it all sorted out.
See the RubyScope gem for more information:
